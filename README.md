#README
This is a repo for the small projects that I made.
Here is a list of such projects and a brief description:
* **Sorting Algorithms:** This program contains implementations for different *O(nlogn)* sorting algorithms, including quicksort, mergesort and heapsort.
* **Splay Tree:** This program is an implementation of splay tree for intervals of values. More descriptions see [here.](http://www3.amherst.edu/~jrglenn92/301/F2014/Projects/P2-SplayTree/splay_tree.html) 
* **Closest Pair:** This program finds the closest pair from a set of points on a 2-D plane. More Descriptions see [here.](http://www3.amherst.edu/~jrglenn92/301/F2014/Projects/P1-ClosestPair/closest_pair.html) 
* **Shortest Path:** This program uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest graph in a specific type of graph. More descriptions see [here.](http://www3.amherst.edu/~jrglenn92/301/F2014/Projects/P3-ShortestPaths/shortest_paths.html) 
* **The Coin Change Problem:** This program calculates how many ways you can make change for an amount, given coin denominations using dynamic programming.
*  **The Maximum Subarray:** Given an array, this program finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray and a non-contiguous subarray.
* **Trie Tree:** This program implements a trie tree to see if a certain string is in the dictionary. More descriptions see [here.](http://hihocoder.com/problemset/problem/1014)
* **KMP:** My implementation of the classic KMP string matching algorithm.
* **01Knapsack:** My implementation of the 01 knapsack problem.
* **General Knapsack:** My implementation of the general knapsack problem
* **Maximum Value of Gifts:** A program using dynamic programming to find the path with the largest value. More descriptions see [here.](http://codercareer.blogspot.com/2014/10/no-56-maximal-value-of-gifts.html)
