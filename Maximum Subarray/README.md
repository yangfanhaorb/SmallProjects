**Problem Statement**

Given an array A={a1,a2,â€¦,aN} of N elements, find the maximum possible sum of a

Contiguous subarray
Non-contiguous (not necessarily contiguous) subarray.
Empty subarrays/subsequences should not be considered.

**Input Format**

First line of the input has an integer T. T cases follow. 

Each test case begins with an integer N. In the next line, N integers follow representing the elements of array A.

**Output Format**

Two, space separated, integers denoting the maximum contiguous and non-contiguous subarray. At least one integer should be selected and put into the subarrays (this may be required in cases where all elements are negative).
